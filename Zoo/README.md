Zoo

What is the purpose of the program? This is a digital representation of a zoo and represents OOP Princples.

OOP Principles

Inheritance: child classes will contain the properties and methods from their parent classes.
We demonstrate this in the project by having children inherit properties from parents without specific code to reassign.

Polymorphism: is the ability to make modifications to inhertited properties and methods.
We demonstarte this in the project by using methods/properties that we later redefine values.

Abstraction: ability to define properties without values.
In this project we define methods/properties early on that lack values, we later override these with values as necessary.

Encapsulation: hiding innerworking/details of program from outside.
We could use private classes to prevent information from being available.
