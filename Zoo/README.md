Zoo

What is the purpose of the program? This is a digital representation of a zoo and represents OOP Princples.

OOP Principles

Inheritance: child classes will contain the properties and methods from their parent classes.
We demonstrate this in the project by having children inherit properties from parents without specific code to reassign.

Polymorphism: is the ability to make modifications to inhertited properties and methods.
We demonstarte this in the project by using methods/properties that we later redefine values.

Abstraction: ability to define properties without values.
In this project we define methods/properties early on that lack values, we later override these with values as necessary.

Encapsulation: hiding innerworking/details of program from outside.
We could use private classes to prevent information from being available.

Interface: is a type defition similar to a class, except that it represents a contact
between an object and its user.  It can neither be instantiated as an object, nor can data memebers be defined.

In this project I have implemented interfaces to show animals who swim and those that might be sports team mascots.
The swimming animals will display why they swim fast, while the mascots
will display a phrase supporting a city associated with the animal.
